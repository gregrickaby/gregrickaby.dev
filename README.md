## Why?

Balancing personal and professional content on a single domain at [gregrickaby.com](https://gregrickaby.com) has been tricky. In the past, when I published personal content I recieved complaints.

The `.dev` TLD is going give me an opportunity to offload all my development focused blog content to its own domain, while retaining my brand (my name). I now have the freedom to publish personal content on my personal blog again! ðŸ¤Ÿ

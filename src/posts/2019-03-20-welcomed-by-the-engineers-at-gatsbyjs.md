During Hacktoberfest, I was reminded that I had a [single contribution](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/3296#ref-commit-a961722) to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) back in late 2017. It was a classic "capital P dangit" drive-by on the documentation that so many of us "WordPress devs" are (in)famous for. [Kyle](https://github.com/KyleAMathews) was kind enough to merge in my pull request.

I played around with v1 of Gatsby on my local, but, was ultimately frustrated because I couldn't get images to work. I got busy with my day job, and haven't looked back.

With Gatsby v2 out, I thought I would give it another try on [Github](https://github.com/gregrickaby/gatsbyv2-blog) and [Netlify](https://gatsbyv2-blog.netlify.com/). I took the Pro Gatsby 2 course from Level Up Tutorials, and have been deep diving into GraphQL as of late, and here are a few initial thoughts on Gatsby:

1. **I love the CLI.** After working with Ghost v2 last year, this feels very natural. I spun up a repo, committed my changes immediately and pushed to Github.
2. **I love how simple it is to deploy to Netlify.** All I had to do was connect Netlify to this Github repo, it configured everything for me and within 2-minutes I had a website. 
3. **I'm excited that it's all React and GraphQL.** I've taken a few courses, dabbled building a couple small React things, but nothing at this scale. This will force me to learn it, deeply.
4. **The community has welcomed me and my newb ideas with open arms.** Because I'm considered a "maintainer", (a title I don't deserve, but anyone who opens a PR to Gatsby is celebrated!) I was been invited to the weekly Maintainers call (Wednesdays at 11:45ET). They opened the call by asking feedback from the community about anything...nobody spoke up and there was some awkward silence. I worked up the nerve, un-muted and imposter syndrome and all talked about how I thought _the on-ramp to Gatsby Theme's was too steep for beginners_. Instead of being criticized, everyone started nodding and asking questions-- encouraging me to keep expressing my feelings. By the end of the call, I had amassed a dozen new Twitter followers and am going to do a pair-programming session on Gatsby Themes, on a Live Stream! I'm thrilled to be the giunea pig and help some advanced devs see their code through the eyes of an old WordPress dev.

My short journey into Gatsby, GraphQL, and React has already been rewarding and has most certainly reinvigorated this grizzled old WordPress dev. I'm so excited for what's next!!

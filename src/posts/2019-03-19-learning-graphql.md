After taking the Pro Gatsby 2 course, I felt a little unsure of myself when it came to GraphQL. There was terminology thrown around like, "mutations" and "enums" that made me think "WTF?" 😱

I drudged on anyway with both this blog and my self-paced GatsbyJS continuing education. Well, about two weeks ago, while trying to figure out how to use [Gatsby Image with NetlifyCMS](https://gregrickaby.dev/posts/2019-03-11-using-frontmatter-from-netlifycms-with-gatsby-image/) it was abundantly clear... **I needed to learn GraphQL first.**

So, I've taken a few courses like:

1. [Learning GraphQL](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-graphql)
2. [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/)
3. [GraphQL Essentials](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/graphql-essential-training)

I have around 15 pages of notes from these courses, and am no longer scared of the terminology. And just **today, I** [**wrote and executed**](https://github.com/gregrickaby/learn-graphql/issues/1#issuecomment-474593128) **my first GraphQL mutation** on the Github API! 🔥

This adventure has me pretty pumped, and I'm no longer thinking "WTF" when it comes to GraphQL. 💪🏻
